# FlowerRecogntiion
FlowerRecogntiion with Pytorch
- It is a deep learning project using Pytorch. Found the datasets on kaggle and prepared the datasets for
training.There are different form of datasets classes such as daisy,dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip.
The aim of this project is to predict the target image. Steps used are importing required libraries by seeing the image data
then preparing Datasets and Data loaders,using gpu then defining the model and train the model. 
- Model used is Resnet9 architecture and add a batch normalization layer which normalizes the outputs of the previous
layers. And At last train the model the highest accuracy of epochs i got in this classifications 83.41% and at last
prediction.
